## 🔎 Overview

The **Markdown-Editor** is a simple desktop/web-based editor where users can write Markdown and see a live preview of the rendered result. It's built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

* Provide an easy-to-use editor for writing Markdown with real-time preview.
* Useful for documentation authors, bloggers, students, or anyone writing in Markdown.
* No heavy dependencies; lightweight and straightforward to set up.
* Can be used as a learning project to see how live-preview works (DOM updates, rendering, etc.).

### 3. Edit Markdown

* The **left pane** (editor area) is where you write Markdown.
* The **right pane** (preview) will show the rendered result as you type.

## 📝 Examples

| Markdown Input                 | Preview Output             |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| `# Hello World`                | Big heading “Hello World”  |
| `**bold** _italic_`            | **Bold** and *italic* text |
| `- Item 1\n- Item 2`           | Bulleted list              |
| `[GitHub](https://github.com)` | A clickable link to GitHub |

*(You can add more: code blocks, images, blockquotes, tables, etc., depending on what you support or plan to support.)*

---

## ✅ Best Practices

* Escape user input that's inserted into HTML to avoid **XSS vulnerabilities**.
* **Debounce input event** (typing) so that rendering isn’t too heavy on large texts.
* Use a well-tested **Markdown parser** (if integrated) instead of hand-rolling complex parsing.
* Make the UI **responsive**: allow themes or dark mode if possible.
* **Accessibility**: ensure keyboard navigation works, labels, tab focus, etc.
